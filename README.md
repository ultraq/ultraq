### ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer at [Upstock](https://www.upstock.app/); writer and baker (and a whole host of other things I've failed to list) in my spare time, based in the tiny little country of New Zealand.

I'm a computer programmer by trade; my career having started in server-side Java development, though I now spend my days with everything HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I also do a bit of coding in my spare time, including [a classic Command & Conquer remake project written in Groovy](https://github.com/ultraq/redhorizon), occassional contributions to the [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) project, and a whole host of smaller projects, all of which you can find on my GitHub profile which you're probably looking at right now!

I've also delved into several non-coding subjects over the years, the main thing being writing (my website is basically a blog and repository of my stories), and I do pick up a musical instrument (guitar, piano) from time to time.
